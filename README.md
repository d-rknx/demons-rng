rng lol
a python knock off of the trash (but popular) sols rng.
made this as a side project

note: the highest number is rlly large, so technically it goes to infinity. thats why you may roll a 1 in 2 10 times then get a 1 in 100,392,483,484,192,490. 
its a higher chance you roll a bigger number than a small number, because of the equality rule (i think thats what its called i might be wrong)
